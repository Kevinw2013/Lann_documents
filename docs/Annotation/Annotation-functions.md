# How to annotate entitied and relations

Now that you have set your desired schema, you are ready to start annotating your corpus. First, open your desired file, then

> To assign entity

Place your mouse over a word/phrase to highlight it and assign an appropriate entity to the selected text.

> To assign relation

A relation consists three parts: the starting entity, the ending entity and the relation type.

First, click on the label of the starting entity to highlight it, then a pop up windown will tell you that the process of annotating a relation is started.

Next, click on the label of the ending entity to highlight it. If there is only one relation type between these two entities, a relation labeled with that specific type will be automatically created; otherwise, you need to select a relation type and a relation will be created accordingly.

* Please note that the label of the starting entity will have a [ * ] icon ![logo](../_icon/relation-start.png  ) added to its front, while the label of the ending entity will have a [ * ] icon ![logo](../_icon/relation-end.png ) added to its back. If an entity acts as a starting entity in one relation, and an ending entity in another, it will have [ * ] ![logo](../_icon/relation-double.png ) added to both sides of the label.

> Delete/Replace labels

Click the ![logo](../_icon/label-menu.png ) icon on the left side of the label will pop up a list, providing options for you to delete/replace the label of the current annotation or in the entire file.

If you are an administrator, you can also delete/replace the label annotated in the entire project.

> Finalize the annotations

Once the annotations are finished, click the ![logo](../_icon/finalize.png )  button at the bottom left to finalize it. 

The status of the file will be changed from unprocessed/processed to finalized.

* Note: only finalized annotations will be used for [ **inter-annotator agreement check** ](Quality-control/Inter-annotator-agreement-checking.md#how-to-get-high-quality-annotations) and [ **quality test** ](Quality-control/Quality-test.md#Quality-Test).
