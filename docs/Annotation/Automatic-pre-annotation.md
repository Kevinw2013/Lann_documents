# Pre-annotation and suggestions

As annotating a corpus from scratch may be a time-consuming and costly process, LANN offers an advanced feature called "pre-annotation" function which facilitates this process. The "pre-annotation" function uses online machine learning and customizable dictionaries uploaded by users.

With LANN you can upload existing annotations, the output of your models and dictionaries. You can use these in two ways either

1. As Pre-annotations to help your team work faster

2. To review the outputs of NLP models and refine their outputs.
