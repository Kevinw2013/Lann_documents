# Create Annotation Schema

> Define entity & relation types

Before starting annotation, you need to define the semantic types that you will use for this purpose. Semantic types in LANN refer to entities (e.g, ‘protein’, 'lab test') and the relations between them (e.g, 'aspirin' treats 'headache').

Click ![logo](../_icon/add-entity.png ':size=80x40') and ![logo](../_icon/add-relation.png ':size=90x40') to create new entities and relations.

Hierarchical categories of entites could also be created by adding child enties. Click the ![logo](../_icon/add.png ':size=50x40') icon on the right of each entity to add child. For example, 'cancer' is a child under 'disease', 'England' is a child under 'country'.

> Reuse exisitng annotation schema

There are two ways to reuse existing annotation schema already defined elsewhere:

* Read the annotation schema from uploaded files: When you upload annotated files in the ![logo](../_icon/DataSource.png ':size=150x40') module, there is an option of **"Create entity and relation types based on annotations"** . With you permission, annotation schemas will be read from your files and generated automatically in this new project.

* Copy annotation schemas from an existing project: Click the ![logo](../_icon/duplicate.png ':size=110x40') button on the top right of the annotation schema page, then you can select a project previously built and replacate its annotation schema.

> Customize colors for entity & relation visulaization of the project

For the best of annotation visualization, each entity and relation are shown with a color. Click the ![logo](../_icon/color.png ':size=200x40') button on the right of each entity to change the color, so that to customize the colors of each project.
