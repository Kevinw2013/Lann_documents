# Quick start

We're Going to set up a basic annotation project in LANN. The only prerequisite is that you should already have the data you want to label:)

Just follow these simple steps.

# 1. Create the annotation project

If your the creator of a project you are the project owner and administrator, otherwise ask the administrator to promote you.

Click the +Project button on the upright corner of the project list page;

Give your project a name and select the annotation task - to label entities alone or both enties and relations.

# 2.  Import data to the project

Both text and PDF files can be annotated. The data can be uploaded or read from a database. If you aleady annotated files using other tools, no worries, most formats of other common annotation tools are supported in LANN.

Click the datasource button on the left panel;

Select the type of data source;

Upload the files or input db information;

Then press the confirm button to import data to the project.

# 3.  Define an annotation schema

Annotation schemas contain the concepts you will be annotating with.

Click "Guideline/Overview" on the left panel, then click "Edit Entity or Relation" on the top right to enter the annotation schema page.

Click "+ Entity" or "+ Relation" to add a new entity or relation inside. 

# 4.  Create an annotation guideline

Annotation guidelines contain the definition of each entity and relation to be annotated, instructions of how to annotate them, and examples.

Click "Guideline/Overview" on the left panel, then click "Edit guideline " on the top right to enter the guideline editing page.

Click "Entity", or "Relation" on the left index to find a list of entities or relations you just defined. Once selected, you can then edit its guideline on the right text box.


# 5.  Create an annotation task

Now that we have a dataset, and defined schema and guidelines, click "Annotation" on the left panel to enter the annotation page.

Click "+ Task" to select files and the annotator(s) to work on the first task.

# 7.  Label Data

Click the task name to view the file list

Click one file name then you can start annotation.
